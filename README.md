# Weather-trend-analysis
Udacity project to analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends

To create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in Austin.

Extract the data from the database.  
Write a SQL query to extract the city level data. Export to CSV.
Write a SQL query to extract the global data. Export to CSV.
Open up the CSV in Python.
Create a line chart that compares Austin's temperatures with the global temperatures. Make sure to plot the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable.
Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and Austin's averages, as well as overall trends.
Choose three different cities in different continents and compare the temperatures.
